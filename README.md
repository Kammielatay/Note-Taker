# Note-Taker

## Description
For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

This application tested my ability to use an Express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. I also learned how to use API routes and how to deploy on Heroku.
